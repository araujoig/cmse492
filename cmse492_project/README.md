# Anomaly Detection in Financial Trading Data

## Project Description
This project aims to develop an unsupervised machine learning model for detecting anomalous trading patterns within financial market data. By identifying unusual trading behaviors, we can spot potential market manipulation or fraudulent activities. The goal is to create a real-time system capable of flagging significant deviations from normal market activities.

## Project Objectives
- **Develop** a machine learning model to detect anomalous trading patterns in financial data.
- **Implement** an unsupervised learning system for real-time anomaly detection that flags potential irregularities for further investigation.
